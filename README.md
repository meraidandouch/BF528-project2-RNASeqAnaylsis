# Project Description

This repository contains the codes and writeup for Project2.

This project focuses on reproducing the finidngs from Oâ€™Meara et al. In this study, the authors, have validated the transcriptional data of cardiac myocytes from mice to identify potential regulators of cardiac regeneration. This study was done to better understand how neonatal mice regenerate their heart tissue but lose this ability later in development.

In this project, sequencing data of neonatal mice was extracted, aligned to a reference and differential expression analysis was done to identify genes associated with myocyte differentiation.
